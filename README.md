# BNWHY
A private Q&amp;A forum whose main purpose is to be a place for my team at BNYM to ask questions regarding the main tools, languages and software that we use on a daily basis. These tools include Alterys, SQL, Share Point, OCR, R, Python, VBA, and Blue Prism. The user can create a profile and login using their username and password. Then they will be able to write a question about one of these specific tools and another team member can answer or send a link to the answer.  

# Benefits
The main benefit to this rather than just asking an individual on the team a question is that all the questions and answers will be available for the team acting as a great resource to use incase a burning question has been asked already! This is great for all new and old and will potentially save a lot of time if used as intended. 

## Live site coming soon!
